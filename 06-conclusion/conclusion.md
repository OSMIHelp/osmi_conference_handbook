-#Mental Health is Important

We at Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation hope this guide has been helpful for you to raise awareness of your mental health at tech conferences and in life in general. Through discussing mental health tips and resources, we hope to help break down the stigma around discussing mental health and make it easier for everyone focus on their mental health and find the resources they need.

Take care of yourself, take care of your community, and thank you for attending KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2020!

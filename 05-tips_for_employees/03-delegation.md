#Delegate to Those Willing to Help

While all the suggestions we have laid out in this section are important, the most important thing is to not burn out by taking all these things upon yourself. Your team needs to be willing and able to take on some of the work.

This should not be done haphazardly, and you should identify people who are on board. Once you have communicated the event plan, keep a look out for people who can be given tasks, such as being a point of contact, working through the Code of Conduct, or pairing up teams. This will help you have a smooth running event, a better vendor or sponsor experience, and a better team dynamic overall.

Delegate! It's the first step to empowering a better conference and event team while handling issues in an efficient and manageable way.

#Know Who to Contact

The first step for anyone working a conference, be it a vendor, sponsor, organizer, or volunteer, is knowing who to contact when something happens. "What happens" can include a medical issue, a mental health issue, a Code of Conduct violation, or a security-related issue. Any of these things can occur at any given event, virtual or in person.

##Vendors and Sponsors

When approaching a new event, it's important to familiarize yourself with the environment. The larger the event, the more important it is to know who to contact in case something happens - most importantly, a team contact and an event or organizer contact.

Having a single point of contact on your team for issues means there is an easy-to-follow protocol should something go in an unexpected direction. This person need not be the same for every event, but should be available at all times when this role is assigned to them.

Knowing what organizer to contact with issues is also important. These folks should know what to do with any emergency situation or Code of Conduct violation. Hopefully, you will have a contact before the event begins and there will be an opportunity to talk with this person and get to know them early in the conference.

These may seem less necessary for virtual events - but the opposite is actually true!! Knowing who you will need to contact are even more critical for a virtual event because it is more difficult to look around a find someone or to even have a way to ask others around you about where to go for help. Often there will be a back channel for sponsors and speakers, though attendees should be clear on where help can be found as well.

##Organizers and Volunteers

If you are a part of the team organizing the event, it is likely you will be the "go-to" person, or at least expected to know what to do. Prior to the event, familiarize yourself with the virtual environment before the event begins.

Be sure you and everyone on your team is familiar with and able to execute the tenets of the Code of Conduct. If something does happen, every person on the organizing team should know how to handle it.

##Conclusion

Knowing who to find and who to go to when something occurs is a good step to staying physically and mentally prepared to handle an event. This won't help in preventing any issue from occurring, but it will help you to know what to do if an issue arises.

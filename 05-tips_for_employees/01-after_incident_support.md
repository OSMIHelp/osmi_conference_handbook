# Finding Support After an incident

After a medical issue, mental health incident, or Code of Conduct violation occurs, it is important to remember there may be physical or psychological trauma. It is important that anyone involved, whether the person who suffered the issue or the people who came to help, have support to deal with things that come up afterwards.

## At the event

Some events may have the capacity to provide support staff for incidents. This may go beyond reporting the incident and into some professional assistance. While this is often true of larger events, small events may not have the infrastructure or budget to provide assistance.

If there is no local assistance on staff, consider building a way for your teammates to report or support each other at the event. Make sure no one walks off alone.

## On Your Team

In this case, it is important you look for signs of issues occurring with yourself or within your team. Consider taking stock of anything that occurs and ensuring everyone has a teammate they can confide in.

It's also recommended there is at least one staff person has been trained in [Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/).

## After the Event

It may be the effect of a situation does not present itself on a person until much later. IF anyone on your team that was part of the event starts to show signs of having an issue related to a situation at the event, consider encouraging them to speak with someone. This can be someone with Mental Health First Aid training in your organization or a trained professional.

You will want to ensure anything that happens does not induce long term harm.

## Conclusion

When something happens, there can be both short term and long term effects. Being aware of your team and the issues they may be carrying is an important way to ensure no one is suffering from an issue that occurred at an event.

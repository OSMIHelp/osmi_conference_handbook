# Finding Support After an Incident

After a medical issue, mental health incident, or Code of Conduct violation occurs, it is important to remember there may be physical or psychological trauma. It is important that anyone involved, whether the person who suffered the issue or the people who came to help, have support to deal with things that may come up afterwards.

## During the Event

Some event software may have the capacity to provide support staff for incidents. This may go beyond reporting the incident and into some professional assistance.

If there is no local assistance on staff, consider building a way for your teammates to report or support each other at the event. Make sure everyone on your team knows where it is appropriate for them to discuss any concerns or issues in confidence. Make sure no one logs off of the event for the day feeling unheard. Check in with everyone.

## On Your Team

When participating as part of a team, it is important you look for signs of issues occurring not only with yourself, but also within your team. Consider taking stock of anything that occurs and ensuring everyone has a teammate they can confide in.

It's also recommended that at least one staff person has been trained in [Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/).

## After the Event

It may be that the effects of a situation do not present themselves on a person until much later. If anyone on your team that was part of the event starts to show signs of having an issue related to a situation at the event, consider encouraging them to speak with someone. This can be someone with Mental Health First Aid training in your organization or a trained professional. Do not assume that because an event is over that any issues that occurred at the event are over too. Make sure to check in and give your team members and attendees an opening to report or discuss any lingering issues.

You will want to ensure anything that happens does not induce long term harm.

## Conclusion

When something happens, there can be both short term and long term effects. Being aware of your team and the issues they may be carrying is an important way to ensure no one is suffering from an issue that occurred at an event.

## Know the Procedure for Processing Medical and Code of Conduct Issues

Many events are lucky in that they are successful in not having any medical or Code of Conduct (CoC) issues. Many, but not all. It is important to keep the procedure for handling such incidents in mind when participating in an event of conference.

## Medical issues

For medical issues, it's important to be aware of your surroundings first and foremost. It may be important to know where teammates are and to check in on them regularly. This is less paramount with a virtual event, but it is important.

Be aware of what to do and, if there is no other course of action, do not hesitate to call 911.

## Code of Conduct Issues

Vendors and sponsors are just as responsible for knowing the Code of Conduct for an event as any speaker or attendee. While the general intent of most CoCs are similar, knowing how to take action if necessary may differ from event to event.

Similar to medical issues, knowing who to contact if a CoC issue presents itself is important. Ensure proper reporting occurs and anyone involved is taken care of. This can be anything from making sure a witness to an incident has their voice heard to comforting someone in need after an incident.

While much of this may fall more squarely on the shoulders of organizers, if something happens to you or your team, it's important to be aware of how to handle things.

# Conclusion

Knowing what to do at an event is the key to ensuring safety when an issue arises. Have a plan, make sure your team at the event knows the plan.

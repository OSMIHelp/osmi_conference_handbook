# Don't Go It Alone

Most times, as a vendor, sponsor, organizer, or volunteer you are not alone at the conference or event - even if you are the only person in your home during a virtual event! While the immediate benefit of having others there is meeting new people and being part of a wonderful community, a secondary benefit is the ability to partner up during an event and share responsibilities and knowledge.

## Work in Pairs

Working in pairs in code and infrastructure is always beneficial. Doing so at conferences and events is just as important. With a team or even just a pair of people, each person has someone they can share with or report to if they witness a Code of Conduct violation, see a medical issue present itself, or in general, just for social well being.

While there are always many people at an event, it is good to have someone with you who is supportive and willing to listen.

## Watch Your Pairs

At the event and after, it's important to make sure your pairs work well together. If you notice something unbalanced or one of the members of the pair speaks up about being uncomfortable, work to make sure that pair isn't put together again or work to reassign folks on the fly.

## Conclusion

No one should feel the need to face an event alone. Whether they are a seasoned community professional or brand new, making people as comfortable as possible makes for a better experience.

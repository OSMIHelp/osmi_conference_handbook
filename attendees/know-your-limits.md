# Know Your Limits While Challenging Yourself

It's important to know what you can handle and what will make you uncomfortable. While you are at the conference, make sure you respect your limits to keep yourself in a healthy state. However, don't let your insecurities mask themselves as limits. Make sure you challenge yourself to meet new people, learn new things, and step outside your comfort zone where you feel safe doing so. On the flip side, don't feel like you have to see and or be at everything. It is perfectly acceptable to skip a block of talks to take an hour or two to decompress in your hotel room or in the quiet conference space. This will give you a chance to process what you have learned and rest a bit before heading back out to the conference again. You will learn more and be better equipped to make the most of the conference if you take breaks.
 
One of the most valuable places in a conference is the area where attendees are gathering, commonly known as the "hallway track". The conversations that happen outside of the talks can lead to more personalized discoveries because you can ask questions about your specific situations and technologies. Additionally, this is a great way to grow your network, so you have more people to reach out to when you leave the conference.

# Know How to Get Help

Conferences are great places for learning and networking, but at some point, you may need something, and it's really important to know where you can go to get what you need.

##Conference Staff

Your first point of contact for getting what you need is the conference staff and organizers. There should be information on the conference website about how to get in touch with them before, during, and after the event. On-site, they may have a registration desk or help desk where you can find the staff during the event. Organizers and staff can help you find conference locations and timing information. They can also help you find things near the conference as well if you are not familiar with the area. The organizers and staff are also there to make sure you are safe, so if anything happens that is inappropriate or makes you feel unsafe, find one of them as soon as you are able so that you can report it. Many conferences will have an official procedure for reporting incidents. This procedure may be posted on their website or on placards at the conference itself.

##Code of Conduct

The conference may have a Code of Conduct in place. A Code of Conduct is a document outlining what is considered appropriate and inappropriate behavior at an event as well as the consequences for inappropriate behavior. It will also contain instructions for how to report Code of Conduct violations and how the reports will be handled. If the conference you are attending has a Code of Conduct, be sure to read through it so that you know who to contact if you need to report a violation. It is important to note that you can report an event even if you are not involved but just witness it happening to someone else.

##Emergency Services

If you are attending a conference outside of your local area, especially if it is in another country or area you are not familiar with, check the city or country's website to find out how to contact the local authorities, police, and ambulance/first responders. The venue or conference staff will also be able to tell you how to contact the local emergency services.

##Crisis Services

Your first contact in an emergency should be 911. If you are not sure if it is an emergency, you can contact a crisis line for help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has trained crisis counselors standing by 24/7. They can be reached at 800-273-TALK (8255). You can learn more about their services on their website:

#Finding Important Locations

Knowing the layout of the venue and the location of key rooms and facilities can help make the conference experience much more comfortable and relaxing. Check the conference and venue websites for maps. It's also a good idea to take a look at a map of the area around the conference venue and/or the hotel where you are staying. Some key locations you may want to find are:

- Conference Registration/Help Desk or Staff Office
- Conference Talk Rooms
- Party or Social Locations for the Conference
- Bathrooms
- First Aid

##Quiet Room

Many conferences will provide an area or room where people can go to find a quiet space during the conference. This may be an area where someone can rejuvenate after a lot of social interaction or find a quiet place to work for a few minutes without interruptions or distractions.

##Prayer Room

A non-denominational prayer room may be available to provide a quiet space for reflection, prayer, meditation, or other quiet religious activities. If you have any special needs, be sure to talk to the conference organizers. 

##Nearby Stores

Knowing where you can get basic supplies, medicines, clothing, etc. can be very helpful. Here are a list of stores that may be useful during a conference:
 
- Grocery Store - Not all conference food works for all people. If you have any food sensitivities or even if you just need some comfort food while you are away from home, knowing where the nearest grocery store is can help you stay fed and hydrated.
- Pharmacy - Traveling can be rough on your body. Traveling on airplanes, trains, and public transportation, not to mention surrounded by hundreds of strangers at a conference, leads to exposure to new germs and illnesses. If you come down with something while traveling, knowing where the nearest pharmacy is can insure you get the medicine that you need to get you back on your feet.
- Clothing Store - It's always a good idea to know where you can get more clothing if you need to. You never know when someone is going to spill something on you or something rips in an awkward spot. If you are flying to the conference, there is always a chance that the airline will lose your luggage as well, so knowing where you can pick up a new shirt or pants can keep things moving smoothly.
- Technology Store - Cables break, adapters fail, chargers disappear - it is amazing how many different pieces of technology we need to keep us going, and knowing where to pick up a replacement if something breaks or disappears can be a lifesaver.

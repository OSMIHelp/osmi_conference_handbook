#Posting Reminders

A great way to remind attendees and staff about maintaining mental health is to post reminder signs around the venue for everyone to see. These reminders can be simple things like "Don't forget to take a break." or "Remember to stay hydrated." These types of signs can help encourage everyone to make healthy choices and reminds them of important action items that they may be forgetting if they are focused on learning and keeping up with things in a new environment. It is also helpful to post signs reminding everyone of the services that the conference provides, like quiet spaces and where to go for help.

Signs are a great way to get information about important resources out to those who may be too shy or nervous to ask about them. When someone is struggling with anxiety and needs a quiet space, their anxiety may make it difficult for them to approach the staff and ask for help. Posting signs gives everyone a way to find available resources without having to admit to a stranger that they are struggling.

Not only do these signs help direct people to care for their mental health, but because they are posted publicly, it can make it easier to bring up mental health topics in conversation or to check in with others on their mental health by using the signs as a conversation starter.

Posting signs also signals to everyone that the conference takes mental health seriously and is interested in providing a healthy environment for attendees and staff.

#Signs of Distress

Even though you may not know most of the people you come into contact with at the conference, you can still keep an eye out for signs of a mental health issue. While distress can manifest in different ways for different people, the following are a few common signs that someone may be struggling with a mental health issue.

##Excessive Feelings or Mood Swings

Keep an eye out for anyone feeling very strong emotions that are more than the current situation would normally warrant. These often manifest as over-the-top feelings of fear, sadness, or worry. Sometimes they display as disproportionate irritability and anger, but they could also be feelings that are much more happy and euphoric than they should be. In addition, watch for mood swings that change too quickly from one extreme to another. Extreme emotions of any kind can be a sign that someone is in distress.

##Confusion

Conferences and large crowds can be overwhelming for even the most social of people, but keep an eye out for anyone who seems to be having trouble focusing or concentrating. Watch for signs of confusion, forgetting things that were just said, or anyone who is having trouble following a conversation. At the least, this is a sign of exhaustion. At the worst, they could be having a mental health crisis. In either case, they need someone to check in with them and see if they need anything.

##Unexplained Physical Ailments

While a long day at a conference can reasonably lead to a headache, watch for anyone who seems to have unexplained ailments, especially ongoing aches and pains without cause.

##Response Do's and Do Not's

If you recognize that someone is struggling with a mental health issue, here are some things you should do, or not do, to help them:

*Do* ask the person if they are alright and if they need anything.
*Do not* tell them to "Snap out of it." or "Get over it."

*Do* call a medical professional or emergency services if you are at all worried that this person may need medical attention or may be in danger of harming themselves or others.
*Do not* hesitate to call emergency services if someone is in danger.

*Do* tell a conference staff member what you have noticed. If you know someone who is close to the person in distress, it is good to let them know as well so they can help support the person.
*Do not* post the information to social media or discuss it with the other conference attendees.

*Do* check in with them again later to see if things have improved or if there is anything they need now.
*Do not* give them a treatment plan to follow. Ask them what they need, but do not tell them what they need to do.

*Do* encourage them to get help from a medical professional.
*Do not* tell the person what mental health issue you think they have or attempt to give the person a mental health diagnosis. This information should only be given to them by a medical health professional.

Above all else, let them know that someone cares and is willing to help them if they need it.

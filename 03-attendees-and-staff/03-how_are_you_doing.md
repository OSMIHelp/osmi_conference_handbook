#How Are You Doing?

"How are you doing?" These four simple words can have a large impact on someone struggling with a mental health issue. It shows that you notice that person and are interested in their well-being. Many times, people will simply respond with "Fine." If you feel like someone is not being forthcoming with their answer, you can follow up with another question to try to get beyond the standard, polite responses. Use a question that is more action focused, like "Is there anything you need?", "Are all of your needs being met?", or "Is there anything I can help you find?"

This begins to build a relationship and opens the door for them to ask you for help or let you know that something isn't going well. Even if they don't need anything at the moment, they will remember that you were willing to help them if they need something later. This will make it easier for them to approach you in the future.

# Know Your Limits While Challenging Yourself

It's important to know what you can handle and what will make you uncomfortable. While you are attending the conference, make sure you respect your limits to keep yourself in a healthy state. However, don't let your insecurities mask themselves as limits. Make sure you challenge yourself to meet new people, learn new things, and step outside your comfort zone when and where you feel safe doing so.

##Your Limits Can Change

When you are in your regular routine, you may be fine being social, sitting through meetings, or talking shop with potential clients. At a conference, be aware that your ability to do these things may change because dealing with a new environment eats up some of the resources you normally use to handle these other activities.

##Recharge and Then Get Back To It

While it is good to be a part of the conference talks and social events, don't feel like you have to see and/or be at everything. It is perfectly acceptable to skip a block of talks to take an hour or two to decompress. This will give you a chance to process what you have learned and rest a bit before heading back to the conference again. You will learn more and be better equipped to make the most of the conference if you take breaks.

Additionally, one of the most valuable things during a conference is the area where attendees gather when they are not in talks, commonly known as the "hallway track". The conversations that happen here can lead to more personalized discoveries because you can ask questions about your specific situations and technologies. This is also a great place to grow your network so you have more people to learn from even after you leave the conference, so be sure to find out if the conference has a chat room or a breakout chat where attendees can gather to talk.

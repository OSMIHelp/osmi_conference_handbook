##Quiet Room

Location: Fira Gran Via Room CC8.30, Hall 8.1
All attendees may feel free to use the Quiet Room as needed. It is a physical space where conversation and interaction are not allowed, where attendees can go if for any reason they can’t interact with other attendees at that time.

##Nearby Stores

Knowing where you can get basic supplies, medicines, clothing, etc. can be very helpful. Here are a list of stores that may be useful during a conference:
 
- [Grocery Store](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRq5BU8VJuRZSoTa6) - Not all conference food works for all people. If you have any food sensitivities or even if you just need some comfort food while you are away from home, knowing where the nearest grocery store is can help you stay fed and hydrated.
- [Pharmacy](https://goo.gl/maps/XNMogvFE24NNDnei8) - Traveling can be rough on your body. Traveling on airplanes, trains, and public transportation, not to mention surrounded by hundreds of strangers at a conference, leads to exposure to new germs and illnesses. If you come down with something while traveling, knowing where the nearest pharmacy is can insure you get the medicine that you need to get you back on your feet.
- [Clothing Store](https://goo.gl/maps/MLxifmBmLFP8P5Qf6) - It's always a good idea to know where you can get more clothing if you need to. You never know when someone is going to spill something on you or something rips in an awkward spot. If you are flying to the conference, there is always a chance that the airline will lose your luggage as well, so knowing where you can pick up a new shirt or pants can keep things moving smoothly.
- [Technology Store](https://goo.gl/maps/F78zrcDHNGEUdSGF6) - Cables break, adapters fail, chargers disappear - it is amazing how many different pieces of technology we need to keep us going, and knowing where to pick up a replacement if something breaks or disappears can be a lifesaver.

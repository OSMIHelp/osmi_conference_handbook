#Be Kind

Everyone at a conference is outside of their normal environment, and they are all under more stress than normal. When you interact with other people, be compassionate. Remember that you do not know what they went through to get to the conference, what they are dealing with outside of the conference, or even what they are dealing with at the conference. Be extra kind to those around you. A little extra patience can go a long way in telling someone thank you for making the effort to attend our event or thank you for all of your hard work in making this event happen.

##Polite Speech

At a conference, you have people from all different walks of life - different ages, different races, different economic status, different backgrounds, different religions, different upbringings. Keeping your speech polite can help everyone feel included. Where you are from, swear words or slang words may be common place and expected, but that may not be the case for others. By using polite speech, you can help everyone feel comfortable and welcomed at the event.

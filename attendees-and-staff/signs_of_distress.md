#Watch for Signs of Distress in Others

Even though you may not know most of the people you come into contact with at the conference, you can still keep an eye out for signs of a mental health issue. 

##Excessive Feelings or Mood Swings

Keep an eye out for anyone feeling very strong emotions that are more than the current situation would normally warrant. These often manifest as over-the-top feelings of fear, sadness, or worry. Sometimes they display as disproportionate irritability and anger, but they could also be feelings that are much more happy and euphoric than they should be. In addition, watch for mood swings that change too quickly from one extreme to another. Extreme emotions of any kind can be a sign that someone is in distress.

##Confusion

Conferences and large crowds can be overwhelming for even the most social of people, but keep an eye out for anyone who seems to be having trouble focusing or concentrating. Watch for signs of confusion, forgetting things that were just said, or anyone who is having trouble following a conversation. At the least, this is a sign of exhaustion. At the worst, they could be having a mental health crisis. In either case, they need someone to check in with them and see if they need anything.

##Unexplained Physical Ailments

While a long day at a conference can reasonably lead to a headache, watch for anyone who seems to have unexplained ailments, especially ongoing aches and pains without cause.

#Make Conversations Inclusive   

When you walk into a conference, it can take you back to your childhood days of trying to find a place to fit in. People may have come with co-workers and already know people in the room to talk to. Some are attending solo and may not know anyone in the room. When you are having a conversation, you can make it easy for a new person to join your conversation by leaving a gap in your circle. This is referred to as The Pac-man Rule as the shape of your group should resemble a circle with a piece missing, like the shape of the classic video game character.

Leaving an opening like this makes it simple for someone walking by to pause and instantly join your group. They do not have to interrupt the conversation to join your group, and they won't have to ask anyone to move so they can join your group. They can join your group without a word.

Once someone has filled the gap in your Pac-man shaped circle, take a step back and to one side to widen the circle and form a new gap to welcome another person.

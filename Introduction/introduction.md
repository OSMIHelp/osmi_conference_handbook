As conference season begins, we at OSMI understand the importance of maintaining health and well-being while going out in to the conference world. We have collected the information in this guide to benefit those planning to attend, planning to speak, or planning to send employees to conferences.

While the main focus will be on maintaining mental health, there will be some physical health components as the two often go hand in hand when in a social setting.

Additionally, we understand these tips and guidelines may not be applicable to everyone universally, but should be used as a reference to help anyone who feels the social constructs and timeframes of a conference to be a bit overwhelming.

Take care of yourself, take care of your community, and enjoy conferencing!

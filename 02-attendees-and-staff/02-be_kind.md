#Be Kind

Conferences are stressful times - for attendees, for speakers, and for conference staff. Making the effort to be extra patient and extra kind to others will go a long way to making the conference better for everyone involved. 

When dealing with a frustrating situation with another person, take a moment to remember that they may have just received some distressing news that is making it difficult for them to handle other issues. Or perhaps they just had an angry person harass and mistreat them. Or maybe they just found out that a deadline at work has been moved up and they are really worried about how they are going to make the new deadline. 

Remember to use gentle and polite speech, to stay patient and calm, and to show gratitude.

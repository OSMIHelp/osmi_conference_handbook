## Eat!

One of the first things to go to the wayside, whether you are a speaker, attendee, sponsor, volunteer, or organizer is food. "I'll grab something later" or "I don't have time for a meal" is a sure path to physical illness and a general inability to function at your highest level.

## Eat Proper Meals

Many people think they might be able to get away with a quick bag of crisps or a little snack and be fine, others may try a liquid diet - coffee and water, coffee and water. Neither of these would be the way we eat at home or in the office, why would eat that way at conference?

If you are a three meal a day person at home, that shouldn't change when at an event. Not all conferences provide three meals - many only include lunch and a snack. It will be up to you to determine what calories and foods your body needs.

Time of meals may change, especially if the event isn't in your timezone, but you can adjust to make sure you get the nutrition you need.

## Know Your needs

No one knows better than you what your body can and cannot have. Whether it's a food allergy, a gluten intolerance, a cultural belief - you are probably more aware of your dietary needs than anyone else.

That said, it means it is your responsibility to let people know. Many conferences these days cater to folks who are diabetic, vegan, or vegetarian. Some even have advanced enough to ask about Kosher and Halal meals. That doesn't mean all events are the same.

If you have a dietary need, best to let organizers know *BEFORE YOU ARRIVE*. Most organizations will work to accommodate your needs if you let them know before the event. Bringing it up at lunch is generally not a good wait to get what you need.

## Step Away

Since many events are trying to cater to many, the food options sometimes fall short. Consider taking a conference break and finding somewhere nearby to grab food. This way you have more control over the menu, you can use the time to catch up on work, or chat with friends on topics not related to the conference.

This a perfect way to take a break and see a little of the area the event is being held in. Make sure to manage your time, though, and return before missing something you planned to take in at the conference.

## Stay Hydrated

Coffee and soda are wonderful and delicious. They are not, however, water. Water is what your body craves constantly. It helps maintain physical homeostasis, helps your immune system, and is almost always readily available.

Consider bringing a reusable water bottle to refill as needed.

## Conclusion

Part of your physical well being is keeping that machine you call a body running, and that takes fuel. Before sure to eat meals, maintain healthy eating habits if possible, and drink water. Doing these things will help you to sustain a better attitude and better physical feeling during any event.

#Physical Health

One of the first things to go to the wayside, whether you are a speaker, attendee, sponsor, volunteer, or organizer, is physical health. "I'll grab something to eat later" or "I don't have time for sleep" are a sure path to physical illness and a general inability to function at your highest level.

##Eat Proper Meals

Many people think they might be able to get away with a quick bag of crisps or a little snack and be fine, others may try a liquid diet - coffee and water, coffee and water. Neither of these would be the way we eat during a regular day working from home, so why would you eat that way at a conference?

If you are a three meal a day person on an average day, that shouldn't change when attending a virtual event. Not all conferences provide time for meals - many only include a brief lunch or coffee break. It will be up to you to determine what calories and foods your body needs.

Time of meals may change, especially if the event isn't in your timezone, but you can adjust to make sure you get the nutrition you need when you need it.

##Stay Hydrated

Coffee and soda are wonderful and delicious. They are not, however, water. Water is what your body craves constantly. It helps maintain physical homeostasis, helps your immune system, and is almost always readily available.

Consider having a reusable water bottle nearby to refill as needed, and be sure to keep drinking throughout the day.

##Step Away

Since many events are trying to deliver content to many, the time for eating options sometimes falls short. Consider taking a conference break and stepping away to grab food at your normal eating times. This way you have more control over your eating, and you can use the conference food break as time to catch up on work or chat with friends on topics not related to the conference.

This is also a perfect way to take a break and see a little more of what the event has to offer - like virtual break-outs or a sponsor area. Make sure, though, to manage your time to avoid missing something you planned to take in at the conference.

Part of your physical well being is keeping that machine you call a body running, and that takes fuel. Be sure to eat meals, maintain healthy eating habits, and drink water. Doing these things will help you to sustain a better attitude and better physical feeling during any event.

# Keeping It Clean

Part of moving to a virtual environment for a conference is the need to minimize contact. While this means an easy avoidance of outside pathogens, there should still be an emphasis on self-care and keeping clean while at home.

## Wash Those Hands

Research has found the number of dirt and germs that can be passed through simple hand contact is significant. Washing one's hands often can prevent a multitude of issues and help you prevent passing anything on to others.

This may not seem as obvious when at home, but washing your hands for at least 20 seconds regularly throughout your day can help to keep your work environment clean and your virtual conference environment clean. It also builds good habits for when you are back in your office or at a conference in person.

## General Hygiene

Keeping clean isn't just for hands! Showering and keeping clean while attending a conference (or working from home in general) can often help to keep you feeling fresh and alert. Taking a quick shower or rinse between sessions or as a break can also help to break up the virtual experience and bring you to your next session feeling refreshed and relaxed.

## Cleaning Your Equipment

While a virtual event means you won't be shaking hands, you will likely be doing a good deal of typing and clicking. Make sure to keep your keyboard and mouse clean. Wipe them down regularly even if you are the only person to use them and the only person in your home workspace. Make sure the space where you will be attending the talks is clean and decluttered.

## Conclusion

Cleanliness leads to a healthier environment. This is important at home, at work, and at conferences. While we can't be sure everyone we shake hands or interact with is healthy, we can make sure we are, and in so doing, we can be sure we aren't bringing any event illnesses with us when we leave.

# Keeping it Clean

We've mentioned a few times how conferences and events can lead to more interaction than one is accustomed to. This can mean many cultural norms involving physical contact are observed, from handshakes to hugs to other appropriate forms of contact.

Part of your physical well-being is working against the pathogens and illnesses any large group of people may be passing around. There are simple methods to keep healthy and a few more advanced ones to make sure you aren't the passer or the receiver.

## Wash Those Hands

The number one step to avoiding picking up "conference crud" is to wash your hands. Research has found the number of dirt and germs that can be passed throughsimple hand contact is significant. Washing one's hands often can prevent a multitude of issues and help you prevent passing anything on to others.

Hand sanitizer can be used in a pinch, but it is a stop gap. Using water and soap is the best method to ensure your hands are clean. Don't skimp on the soap and make sure to dry your hands when you are finished.

## General Hygiene

Keeping clean isn't just for hands! Often, events and conferences take place with many people milling about and interacting. To ensure the environment is pleasant, make sure to maintain good hygiene habits.

It's not always easy to maintain the environment at a venue. It can hot or cold, it could make you sweaty one minute, then cold the next. If you are someone who perspires frequently, consider stepping away to clean up or carrying some personal care products so you will have one less thing to worry about.

## Conclusion

Cleanliness leads to a healthier environment. While we can't be sure everyone we shake hands or interact with is clean, we can make sure we are and, in so doing, we can be sure we aren't bringing with us any event illnesses when we leave.

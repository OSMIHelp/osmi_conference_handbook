# Keeping it Clean

Part of moving to a virtual environment for a conference is the need to minimize contact. While this means an easy avoidance of outside pathogens, there should still be an emphasis on self-care and keeping clean while at home.

## Wash Those Hands

Research has found the number of dirt and germs that can be passed through simple hand contact is significant. Washing one's hands often can prevent a multitude of issues and help you prevent passing anything on to others.

This may not seem as obvious when at home, but making washing your hands for at least 20 seconds regularly through out your day can help to keep your work environment clean and your virtual conference environment clean.

## General Hygiene

Keeping clean isn't just for hands! Showering and keeping clean while attending a conference (or working from home in general) can often help to keep you feeling fresh and alert. Taking a quick shower or rinse between sessions or as a break can also help to break up the virtual experience and bring you to your next session feeling refreshed and relaxed.

## Cleaning Your Equipment

While a virtual event means you won't be shaking hands, you will likely be doing a good deal of typing and clicking. Make sure to keep your keyboard and mouse clean. Wipe them down regularly even if you are the only person to use them and the only person in your home workspace. 

## Conclusion

Cleanliness leads to a healthier environment. While we can't be sure everyone we shake hands or interact with is clean, we can make sure we are and, in so doing, we can be sure we aren't bringing with us any event illnesses when we leave.

#Taking Breaks

Whether in real life or in a virtual setting, conferences mean a great deal of social interaction. Even for people who thrive in this environment, it's difficult to process everything when you are moving from interaction to interaction, conversation to conversation, and circle of friends to circle of friends.

The context switching alone is mind blowing! Then there are the people who you have varying levels of familiarity with. It's enough to make anyone's head spin!

Taking breaks or some personal time can help. Whether this means stepping away from your computer or screen for a moment or grabbing a quick nap, taking a break throughout the day, away from people, will enhance your conference experience and your mental and physical well-being.

##Remember the Sun

Even though you are not traveling to attend the conference, there is still value in making sure to get outside and soaking up some natural light. Researchers have found natural light to help with feelings of depression associated with Seasonal Affective Disorder. Getting a bit of sun (or even if it is cloudy, some natural, non-artificial light) can help you.

So take a walk or sit outside for a few minutes. This will give you a nice break from the constant social interaction and give your brain some time to process all you've been seeing in the sessions and conversations.

##Going It Alone

Part of the point of these breaks is to mitigate the constant flow of interaction inherent in conversations and sessions at the conference. It's okay to take a personal moment. As an attendee, it is not reasonable to expect you will attend every session, be at every workshop, and stop at every sponsor's booth, etc.

Getting away from people for a bit to process what you are learning and sharing is a good way to give context to what you are taking in.

##Disengage

One of the purposes of taking a break is to let go of everything going on around you for a few moments. If this means heading off alone to jump on social media to check what's going on at the conference, it will likely not give you the break you are looking for.

If anything, you may feel more stressed or anxious after checking Twitter while trying to take a break. Try to disengage fully for a short while.

##Conclusion

Put your computer and your phone down, walk away, and take a break. Giving yourself time to rest and recuperate will help you feel more calm and more able to participate in the conference.

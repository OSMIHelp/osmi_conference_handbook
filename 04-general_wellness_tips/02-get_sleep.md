# Get Sleep

In the world of conference attendance, sponsoring, speaking, and organizing there is something that bleeds over from the world of being a developer: sleep, or lack thereof. Similar to hitting "the zone" while developing a project and attempting to push without sleep, conference goers often give in to the fear of missing out (also known as FOMO) by skimping on sleep to attend early talks, show up at after parties or events, or hitting a dinner and drinks with fellow conference goers.

This is just as true with virtual events, were the nature of not habing to travel physically gives one an untrue sense of having more energy.

While it is important to maintain connections in the community, it should never be done at the expense of one's physical and mental well-being. Maintaining a manageable schedule is key to enjoying your time at a conference, as much as any activities you might participate in.

## Know Your Needs

Long before you get to the conference, you will likely know the schedule of events. While it's impossible to plan for everything, at the very least you can be in the know on what is likely to happen when.

If you are the type of person who needs eight hours of sleep to be comfortable and rested, don't let the conference change that schedule. Make sure you are getting the amount of sleep your body is used to, and don't convince yourself less sleep is acceptable.

If this means missing out or leaving early from events, better to do so than to risk feeling rundown and missing more moving forward. Take care of your sleep so your body will take care of you.

This becomes even more important as, more often than note, a conference is in a timezone that is not your native timezone. Take into account getting in early may mean it's difficult to stay late. Monitor the time difference and keep an eye on your local clock.

## Take a Break, Take a Nap

Going to a conference is more social interaction than most people would expect for any given day. This can be exhausting even for the most extroverted. Don't let that get you down! It's okay to take breaks or even a nap.

In the virtual conference setting it's easy to take some time to rest, and there is no shame in running to your room to grab a thirty minute power nap or even a full on nap. Do not feel like you are abandoning the conference or the community - we all want you at your best - and that means your most well rested too!

## Work as a Team

It could be you are there with coworkers or teammates, especially if you are speaking or your company or organization is sponsoring. This makes sleep management a little easier - sleep as a team!!

When interacting with conference goers, the more well rested you are, the easier it will be to process everything going on with the presentations, the sponsor booths, and the community.

## Conclusion

Sleep is the key to being able to take in all you can at a conference. With planning, some forethought, and help from friends and coworkers, you should be able to have the best experience without running your battery down so low it takes days to recover.

# Get Sleep

In the world of conference attendance, sponsoring, speaking, and organizing there is something that bleeds over from the world of being a developer: sleep, or lack thereof. Similar to hitting "the zone" while developing a project and attempting to push without sleep, conference goers often give in to the fear of missing out (also known as FOMO) by skimping on sleep to attend early talks, show up at after parties or events, or hitting a dinner and drinks with fellow conference goers.

While it is important to maintain connections in the community, it should never be done at the expense of one's physical and mental well-being. Maintaining a manageable schedule is key to enjoying your time at a conference, as much as any activities you might participate in.

## Know Your Needs

Long before you get to the conference, you will likely know the schedule of events. While it's impossible o plan for everything, at the very least you can be in the know on what is likely to happen when.

If you are the type of person who needs eight hours of sleep to be comfortable and rested, don't let the conference change that schedule. Make sure you are getting the amount of sleep your body is used to, and don't convince yourself less sleep is acceptable.

If this means missing out or leaving early from events, better to do so than to risk feeling rundown and missing more moving forward. Take care of your sleep so your body will take care of you.

## Be Aware

Part of getting the sleep you need is being comfortable and knowing your surroundings or the situations you may find yourself in. Chances are, if you are traveling for a conference, you will be staying in a hotel or some other environment that is not your home.

If you are in a hotel, take some time when you first arrive to get acclimated. If you have allergies, consider requesting non-feather pillow and comforters. Is it tough to get up in the morning and you rely on a partner, significant other, or roommate to help you wake up? Take advantage of the wake-up call service most hotels offer.

Knowing where you are in relation to the conference event is also important. If you arrive early, take a look or even travel to the venue to see what time you'll need in the morning to get there. Not only does this help with planning, it lowers your anxiety and helps to ensure better sleep not worrying about the "getting there" aspect.

## Take a Break, Take a Nap

Going to a conference is more social interaction than most people would expect for any given day. This can be exhausting even for the most extroverted. Don't let that get you down! It's okay to take breaks or even a nap.

If you are lucky and youâ€™re in a hotel next to the conference venue, there is no shame in running back to your room to grab a thirty minute power nap or even a full on nap. Do not feel like you are abandoning the conference or the community - we all want you at your best - and that means your most well rested too!

## Work as a Team

It could be you are there with coworkers, especially if you are speaking or your company or organization is sponsoring. This makes sleep management a little easier - sleep as a team!!

If you have an evening event, but also an early morning booth duty session, make sure your team is covered. There's no need for everyone to be at every part of everything. Make sure some people are at the event and the others are sleeping so they can be on the booth the next morning.

When interacting with conference goers, the more well rested you are, the easier it will be to process everything going on with the presentations, the sponsor booths, and the community.

## Conclusion

Sleep is the key to being able to take in all you can at a conference. With planning, some forethought, and help for friends and coworkers, you should be able to have the best experience without running your battery so down it takes days to recover.

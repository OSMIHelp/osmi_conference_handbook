We at Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) are dedicated to promoting health and well-being at tech conferences. We have collected the information in this guide to benefit those who are planning to attend, speak at, or work at a conference.

While the main focus of this guide will be on maintaining mental health, there will be some physical health components as the two often go hand in hand when in a social setting.

Additionally, these tips and guidelines may not be applicable to everyone universally, but can be used as a reference to help improve the conference experience, especially for anyone who finds the social constructs and time frames of a conference to be a bit overwhelming.

Take care of yourself, take care of your community, and enjoy conferencing!

# Taking Breaks

Whether a small community conference, a giant corporate event, or a massive international event, conferences mean a great deal of social interaction. Even for people who thrive in this environment, it's difficult to process everything when you are moving from interaction to interaction, conversation to conversation, and circle of friends to circle of friends.

The context switching alone is mind blowing! Then there are the people who you have varying levels of familiarity with. It's enough to make anyone's noggin spin.

Taking breaks or some personal time can help. Whether this means stepping away into a quiet corner or running to your hotel for a quick nap, taking a break throughout the day, away from people, will enhance your conference experience and your mental and physical well-being.

## Remember the Sun

We can't promise every conference will have sun. Sometimes, it just doesn't happen. But there is value in natural light. [Researchers have found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8731073) natural to help with feelings of depression associated with Season Affective Disorder. Getting a bit of sun (or at least natural, non-artificial light) can help you.

So, take a walk outside...carefully. Make sure you are familiar with the area and staying safe. This will give you a nice break from the constant social interaction and give your brain some time to process all you've been seeing in sessions and conversations.

## Going It Alone

Part of the point of these breaks is to mitigate the constant flow if interaction inherent in conversations and sessions at a conference. It's okay to take a personal moment. As an attendee, it is not reasonable to expect you will attend every sessions, be at every hack group, and every evening event.

Getting away from people for a bit to process what you are learning and sharing is a good way to give context to what you are taking in.

## Disengage

One of the purposes of taking a break is to let go of everything going on around you for a few moments. This means heading off alone to jump on social media to look at things related to event will not likely give you the break you are looking for.

If anything, you may feel more stressed or anxious after checking twitter while trying to take a break at an event.

## Conclusion

Put the phone down, walk away, take a break. You will feel more calm and ready to participate in more of the conference as you defrag while moving forward.
